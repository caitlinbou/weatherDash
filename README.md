# weatherDash

This is a basic weather dashboard application made using a server side API and a JQuery library. 

WHEN user inputs a city value
THEN user recieves specified weather information for current day and the five-day forecast. This can be customized to meet client need.

Recently searched cities are stored in localStorage and shown as buttons on the page upon refresh. The most recently searched city populates data upon refresh. When clicked, the updated conditions for the selected city are shown.

The safety of the UV index for current day is show in green for favorable, orange for moderate, and red for severe.

The units of measurement are imperial, with temperature in degrees farenheit, and wind in MPH.

To build the structure of this application, I used bootstrap and dynamically created much of the content using jQuery.

For up to date weather information, I used:[OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

I hope you enjoy!
