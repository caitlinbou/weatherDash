# weatherDash

This is a basic weather dashboard application. 

WHEN user inputs a city value
THEN user recieves weather information for current day and the five-day forecast.
Recent Search data is stored in localStorage and shown on the page for up to TODO: cities, and when clicked the updated conditions for that city are shown.
The safety of the UV index for current day is show in green for favorable, orange for moderate, and red for severe.
The units of measurement are imperial, so it shows temperature in degrees farenheit, and wind in MPH.

when the dashsboard is re-opened by user after initila use, the most recently searched city will show.

To build the structure of this application, I used bootstrap.
